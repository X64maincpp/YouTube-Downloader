## Code Overview

### Main Window (`YouTubeDownloader` class)

1. **Initializing the UI:** The application window is created using Tkinter and styled with ttkbootstrap. 
2. **Fetching Video Details:** When the user inputs a YouTube URL and clicks "Fetch Video Details," the `fetch_video_details` method connects to YouTube, retrieves video streams, and populates the quality options.
3. **Downloading Video:** When the "Download" button is pressed, the `download_video` method starts the download process based on the selected video quality and audio options.
4. **Showing Progress:** The `show_progress` method updates the progress bar during the download.
5. **Callbacks:** `success_callback` and `error_callback` handle the completion status of the download.

### Downloading Logic (`download_and_combine_video` function)

1. **Stream Download:** Download the selected stream based on user’s quality choices.
2. **Audio Handling:** Depending on the user’s choice, download audio separately or combine it with the video stream.
3. **Combining Video and Audio:** If separate audio is downloaded, the `moviepy` library is used to combine them into a single video file.
